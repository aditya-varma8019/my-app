    6. What is AJAX? Explain with examples.
</div>
<div class="answer">
    AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It is a technique used in web development to make asynchronous requests to a server from a web page without needing to reload the entire page. AJAX allows you to update parts of a web page without disrupting the user's experience. Example: Let's say you have a web page that displays a list of comments. Instead of refreshing the entire page when a user wants to see new comments, you can use AJAX to fetch and display new comments dynamically. In this example, when the loadComments() function is called, it makes an AJAX request to the server ('comments.php') to fetch new comments. When the response is received, it updates the 'comments' div with the new data without reloading the entire page. AJAX is not limited to XML; it can also work with other data formats like JSON. It has become a fundamental part of modern web development, enabling interactive and responsive web applications.
