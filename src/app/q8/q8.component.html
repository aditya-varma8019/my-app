    8. What is a component in Angular?
</div>
<div class="answer">
    In Angular, a component is a fundamental building block for building web applications. It is a self-contained, reusable piece of user interface
         that encapsulates a specific part of the application's functionality and UI. Components in Angular are responsible for rendering a portion of 
         the user interface and handling the logic related to that portion.
         <br>

        Here are the key characteristics and aspects of Angular components:
        <br><br>
        
        <strong>Reusability:</strong> Components are designed to be reusable. You can create a component once and use it in multiple places throughout your application.
        <br>
        <strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Components encapsulate their behavior and structure, meaning that they manage their own state and functionality independently of
         other components. This helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns.
         <br>
         <strong>Templates:</strong> Each Angular component has an associated template that defines the HTML structure and layout for that component. The template can 
        include placeholders and bindings to display data and interact with the component's logic.
        <br>
        <strong>Logic:</strong> Components contain the logic and behavior specific to their functionality. This logic is typically written in TypeScript, which is a
         superset of JavaScript.
         <br>
         <strong>Input and Output Properties:</strong> Components can have input properties that allow data to be passed into them from parent components, and output
         properties that emit events to notify parent components of changes or actions within the child component.
         <br>
         <strong>Lifecycle Hooks:</strong> Angular provides a set of lifecycle hooks that allow you to execute code at specific points in a component's lifecycle.
         Common lifecycle hooks include ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, ngOnDestroy, and more.
         <br>
         <strong>Dependency Injection:</strong> Components can make use of Angular's dependency injection system to obtain services, which are used to share data and
         functionality across components.
         <br>
         <strong>Metadata:</strong> Components are decorated with metadata using decorators such as @Component. This metadata provides information about the component,
         including its selector, template, styles, and more.
